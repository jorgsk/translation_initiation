* Random vs Pseudo-random:
When generating completely random sequences there are far fewer that make the
cut of my scrutinizer! This means that the wt sequence is perhaps alreadly
somewhat optimized! You have read both that this is true and not true.

Results to come: 

* Statistics on the data sequences (how many changes compared to
what can be expected from the binomial distribution?) PS: you already have this
partly in your program in seq_analysis # of changes at each pos

* Statistics on changes of nucleotides in (high yield) data set, and comparing
this to changes in surviver data set, although this will reflect what nucleotide
changes promote high binding energy

* The odd collection of low-expressing sequences in the (12,38) areas! Why is it
like that? Look for actual structure pictures

* Look at the results from the (0-3,39) again. This time separate from the data
a set that has both high binding energy And high expression! In other words, the
upper right corner.

* Quite important I think: how similar is the order of the sequences over many
windows? Example: high correlation for window (a,b), (c,d), and (k,t). Do the
sequences appear in the same order in all those 3? If so, it would prove that
your method has consistency.

TEST: make the - values to less than 5, like 3, and see what happens.
Changes:

* UP_C from 500 to 300
