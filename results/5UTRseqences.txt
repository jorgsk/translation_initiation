Two sets of 5'UTR sequences obtained through in silico screening.

In the first set the sequences were generated pseudo-randomly to
mimick the generation at a DNA-supply company with a 7% chance of
change at each nucleotide position. As well, in this set the nucleotides
C and T and positions 10 and 25 are fixed.

Set 1:
CACAUAAUAGGGGAGAGUUUAA
AACAUAAUAAAGGAGCCUAGAA
AACAUAAUAACGGAGCCUAGAA
AACAAAAUAAAGGAGAUUAGAA
AACAUUAUAACGGAGCCUAGAA

In the second set the sequencs are generalted totally randomly without
any fixed nucleotides.

Set 2:
