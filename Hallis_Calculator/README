This is a software implementation of the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) Calculator.

The RBS Calculator can predict the translation initiation rate of a protein coding sequence in bacteria. It can also design synthetic ribosome binding site sequences to rationally control the protein expression level. It combines a thermodynamic model of ribosome and mRNA interactions with a sequence optimization algorithm. The RBS Calculator was developed by Howard Salis and Chris Voigt at UC San Francisco.
